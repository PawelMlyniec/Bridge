Grapf G is *isomorphic* with grapf H, if exists Bijection projects vertices graph G into vertices graph H. Where two vertices in graph G are connected with edge, coresponding to them vertices in graph H are also connected with edge.

Write programm, which 
1. Will read two undirected graphs from files
2. Will check if graph are isomorphic, if so will prit function
